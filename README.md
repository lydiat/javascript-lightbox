# javascript-lightbox
A pure JavaScript lightbox gallery using photos from Flickr

# What is it?
A web page that shows a grid of photo thumbnails; when a thumbnail is clicked, the photo should be displayed in a lightbox view, with the ability to move to the next / previous photos and display the photo title.

- Access a public photo API and successfully retrieve data from it;
    - API access/token management, success/failure, cross-site scripting
- Display that data on a page;
    - local storage, array manipulation,
- Update the UI of a page without refreshing;
    - DOM parsing and manipulation by id attr
- Build a polished user experience you'd be proud to ship; and
    - Keystrokes for forward/backward, fade/slide images
